## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SVG Images
- Grid
**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned
When you see with desktop screen it will be 3 grid columns(1fr, 1fr, 1fr). But then with mobile version it will only one column 1fr. 
```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {
    .main {
      grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    }
  }
  
```
